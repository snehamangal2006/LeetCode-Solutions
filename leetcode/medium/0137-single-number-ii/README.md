# Single Number II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears  **three times**  except for one, which appears  **exactly once**.  *Find the single element and return it*.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
- -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
- Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;

        for (int x : nums)
            mp[x]++;

        for (auto x : mp) {
            if (x.second == 1)
                return x.first;
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```
