![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 45

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return n;

        int prev2 = 1; // ways(1)
        int prev1 = 2; // ways(2)

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
            int current = prev1 + prev2;
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }

        return prev1;
    }
};
```
