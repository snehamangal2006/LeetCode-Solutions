# Maximum Enemy Forts That Can Be Captured

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a  **0-indexed**  integer array `forts` of length `n` representing the positions of several forts. `forts[i]` can be `-1`, `0`, or `1` where:

- -1 represents there is no fort at the ith position.
- 0 indicates there is an enemy fort at the ith position.
- 1 indicates the fort at the ith the position is under your command.

Now you have decided to move your army from one of your forts at position `i` to an empty position `j` such that:

- 0 <= i, j <= n - 1
- The army travels over enemy forts only. Formally, for all k where min(i,j) < k < max(i,j), forts[k] == 0.

While moving the army, all the enemy forts that come in the way are  **captured**.

Return *the  **maximum**  number of enemy forts that can be captured*. In case it is  **impossible**  to move your army, or you do not have any fort under your command, return `0` *.* 

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: forts = [1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,1]
Output: 4
Explanation:
- Moving the army from position 0 to position 3 captures 2 enemy forts, at 1 and 2.
- Moving the army from position 8 to position 3 captures 4 enemy forts.
Since 4 is the maximum number of enemy forts that can be captured, we return 4.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: forts = [0,0,1,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since no enemy fort can be captured, 0 is returned.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= forts.length <= 1000
- -1 <= forts[i] <= 1

        for (int x : forts) {
            if (x == 0) {
                count++;
            } 
            else {
                if (previous != 0 && previous != x) {
                    ans = max(ans, count);
                }

                previous = x;
                count = 0;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
